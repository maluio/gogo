# Gogo
Webapp that helps remembering things, in particular when learning languages. 

Inspired by Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net) and the Super Memo algorithm (https://www.supermemo.com/english/algsm11.htm) 

## How it works
Users add what they would like to remember as flash cards.
Gogo presents the flash cards to users during their learning session. Users rate the flash card based on how easy or diffcult it was to remember the 
item in question. Based on this rating Gogo calculates the amount of days in which the flash card gets shown again to users.

## Features
* Masking of words on a flash card. 
* AWS translate API for automatic translatation
* Bing image search API to add images to given search terms

## Technologies
Symfony4 + Api platform + reactJs
